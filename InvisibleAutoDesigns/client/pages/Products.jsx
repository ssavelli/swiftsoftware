          <h1 className="text-center">Clear – Paint Protection Film</h1>
          <p>Our Clear Paint Protection Film kits are available Pre-Cut or Custom Cut. With access to the largest selection of Pre-cut kits available, we can ensure our customers a wide variety of protection to choose from. All of our Pre-Cut kits are downloaded through DAP software and then sent to a plotter for accurate and precise vehicle designs. Although there are a wide variety of pre-cut kit designs available for all make and model vehicles, often times a custom installation offers more thorough coverage, or coverage on area’s where no pre-cut kits are available. Fortunately, unlike many of our competitors, we offer “Custom Cut” kits which can be created for specific area’s or for a complete vehicle wrap.</p>

          <p>Our “Matte” or “Stealth” Clear Paint Protection offers customers the option to change their vehicle’s paint to a unique matte, or satin, finish, while still allowing the vehicles original colour to come through. It can also be used as protection over “OEM” matte vehicle finishes currently offered by BMW, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Mercedes, etc. Matte film offers the same durability as our standard paint protection films and is available in pre-cut or custom cut.</p>
